        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Veena, an aspiring Software Engineer specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Currently pursuing my B.Tech at Er. Perumal Manimekalai College of Engineering, I have a strong passion for problem-solving, machine learning, and web development.

I thrive on creating intelligent solutions that simplify tasks and enhance efficiency. My expertise includes Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Data Science, allowing me to build projects that bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications.

One of my notable projects is a Job Recommendation System, which utilizes AI to match users with job opportunities based on their skills and preferences.

Beyond coding, I enjoy reading books, traveling, cooking, and exploring new technologies. I am eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to impactful projects that push the boundaries of AI and software development.

                <h3>Job Recommendation System</h3>
                <p>The Job Recommendation System is an AI-powered application that helps users find relevant job opportunities based on their skills, experience, and preferences. It utilizes Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze job descriptions and match them with user profiles, ensuring accurate and personalized recommendations.

                    This system uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to rank job listings based on relevance. A Flask-based web interface allows users to enter their details and receive job suggestions instantly. The backend stores job postings and user profiles using a SQL database for efficient data retrieval.
                    
                    By automating the job search process, this project saves time, improves job matching accuracy, and enhances the overall experience for job seekers. Future enhancements include real-time job data scraping, resume parsing, and deep learning models for even better recommendations.</p>
